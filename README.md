#GOOGLE HOMEPAGE CLONE

An assignment from The Odin Project to replicate the Google homepage. Goal is to practice basic HTML and CSS.

##GOALS AND PROCESS

My aim was to closely replicate the appearance of the Google homepage without replicating functionality. I generally avoided using dev tools to inspect the source html and css and instead tried to replicate the look of the page as closely as possible by sight.

##LEARNING OUTCOMES

I solidified my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS and improved my ability to create simple page layouts. As a result of this project I am more comfortable using basic HTML and CSS and have less need to refer to external resources (eg. looking up tags and attributes) to accomplish simple layouts such as headers and footers, forms with text input, and vertically or horizontally centered elements.
